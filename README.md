# BIOSTAT626-Midterm1
The object of this task is to classify activities base on the data from smart device, the training data are the datasets for subject 1 ,3 ,5 ,6 ,7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and test data are the datasets for subject 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24. However, for different individuals, there are differences in the data levels under the same activity, therefore, the training data are classified by subject index as training set and test set and the evaluation of model can be more accurate.
